## Roadmap Help
The generate.py script uses entries in components.csv and the template file roadmap-template.md to automatically generate the roadmap page. If you wish to update the roadmap page, make changes to the roadmap template file in docs_dev and edit the entries in the components file using your favorite csv editor. Then run generate.py to update those changes to the official page in the docs folder.
**NOTE**: If you make changes to ROADMAP.md, they will be overwritten whenever you run generate.py
